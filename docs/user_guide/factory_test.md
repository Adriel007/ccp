# Web App for factory performance test

In this guide we describe how to use the web app to perform calculations for a factory test following the ASME PTC 10 standard.

The web apps are located in the ~/ccp/app folder and are named as follows:
 - ccp_app_straight_through.py
 - ccp_app_back_to_back.py

You can run these apps by typing the following command in the terminal:

```bash
streamlit run ~/ccp/app/ccp_app_straight_through.py
```

Or, if you are on Windows, you can execute the batch files:
 - ccp_app_straight_through.bat
 - ccp_app_back_to_back.bat

## Straight-Through App

## Back-to-Back App
